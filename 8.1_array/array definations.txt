A subarray is a contiguous sequence of elements within an array  (should be continuous
for instance the subarrays of the array{1,2,1} would be {1},{2},{1,2},{2,1},{1,2,1},{}

A substring is just a subarray that is made up of only characters

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements
this means a subsequence is a genralized subarray, where the rule of contiguity does not apply
ex-> {A,B,C}
{A},{B},{C},{A,B},{B,C},{A,C},{A,B,C},{}

A set is subset of another set if all its elements are contained by that set
This means neither contiguity nor ordering of elements matter
subset do not need to preserve element order. As a result both {1,2} and {2,1} are same

*if we have n numbers than the number of pairs we can form is n(n-1)/2
